YOU WILL NEED PYGAME TO RUN THIS PROGRAM (visit pygame.org for more information)

This game is my first "proper" game, and is a passion project.
This project orignially started as a rock paper scissors program, but quickly evolved into its current form.
All in game assets are made by me.
In total, this project took about 13 hours, starting on 29 November, 2021, and ending on 4 December, 2021.
The premise of the game is that two players want to live longer than the other by trying not to "touch red".
To navigate the menu, use Arrow Keys/WASD and SPACE/ENTER.

Programs used:
Thonny
GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program)
Pygame

Feel free to do whatever you want with this code, just make sure to credit me.
